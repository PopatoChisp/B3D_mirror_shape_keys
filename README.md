# Blender Mirror Shape Key Script
## How to Use
Batch mirrors your shape keys depending their names.  
The shape key names have to end with Left, Right, L or R in order to be detected.  
It will replace the existing ones. But you can set it to ignore the one at the begining or end shape keys if you're python-savy enough ^^'  
The script has no UI, and only mirrors in the X axis like the default Blender function.  
## Information
I'm only a beginner with python and blender. Defo not production ready but good enough to do what it's made for.  
I made this script to mirror about +26 keys for ARKit/Vtuber tracking. It will save you and me from getting mad over small adjustments lol. I don't think I'll update it soon, but adding reordering would be my next priority if it were the case.  
Made in Blender 4.0  
## Installation
* Download the Shape_key_mirror.py
* Open the text editor in Blender (or open the scripting workspace)
* Open the py script via the editor
* Select the shape key/side to be cloned and hit run script  
Voil√†!
